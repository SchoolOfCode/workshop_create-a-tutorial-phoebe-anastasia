# Props, State, and Context in React - Tutorial

You've probably used your fair share of online resources as you've progressed through the course, whether it's official getting started guides in various docs or articles and videos that devs just like you have put together to help the community. There's also no better way of learning about subjects in depth than explaining them to someone else.

Now it's time to give that a try yourself. Work together to make something that explains the following subjects:

- Props
- State 
- [Context](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context)

For each, think about what they are in principle, why and how you'd want to use them, and how you can show an example. For props and state, this involves reviewing and going deeper into topics you're already familiar with, whereas with context, this will involve learning something new, experimenting, etc. Feel free to use this repository to try out code and create any examples.

Also, think about how these three concepts are interrelated. How are they alike and different? When would you use one versus another (such as passing information down with props vs context)? What advantages, disadvantages, and tradeoffs are there?

You can choose what format your tutorial will take (video, article, etc.), but remember that this is an opportunity to deepen your understanding and practice your communication about tech concepts rather than an exercise in who can make the snazziest-looking end product - spend the majority of the time on the research and content! Your priority is exploration and understanding through communication.

Once you're finished, we'll tell you how to share the link to what you've produced!
