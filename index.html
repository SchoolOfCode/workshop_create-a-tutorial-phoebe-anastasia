    <h1>Phoebe & Anastasia's React Guide</h1>
    <h3>Props</h3>
    <h2>What props are in principle?</h2>
    <br>
    <p>React has a concept known as props, props is just a shorter way of saying properties. Props allow us to make our components reusable by passing data from one component to
    another with the use of parameters. Props are passed to a JSX tag.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Why you'd want to use props</h2>
    <br>
    <p> We are able to access all of the properties by passing the data dynamically in App.js to the custom component (from a parent component to a child component(s)).</p>
    <br>
    <h2>How you'd want to use them</h2>
    <br>
    <p><b>Using props without destructuring</b></p>
    <br>
    <p>You need to pass props as an argument to the function for your custom component similar to how you would pass an argument in a vanilla JavaScript function; </p>
    <figure>
        function ListItem (props) {
            const title = props.title;
            const content = props.content;
              return (
                <div>
                  <h1>My name is {title}.</h1>
                  <p>My favorite item is {content}.</p>
                </div>
              );
          }
          
          export default ListItem
    </figure>
    <br>
    <p><b>Using props with destructuring</b></p>
    <br>
    <p>Similarly, to the previous section the code is exactly the same as without destructuring props. The only difference is where you're declaring props they're passed as a variable to the function instead of as an argument.</p>
    <figure>
        function ListItem({title, content}) {
  
            return (
              <div>
                <h1>My name is {title}.</h1>
                <p>My favorite item is {content}.</p>
              </div>
            );
        }
        
        export default ListItem
    </figure>
    <p><b>Setting default values for props</b></p>
    <br>
    <p>You can also pass funtions and data from objects in your props. You can pass in default value to your props if you'd rather them be empty when created;</p>
    <figure>
        function ListItem({title, content}) {

            return (
              <div>
                <h1>My name is {title}.</h1>
                <p>My favorite item is {content}.</p>
              </div>
            );
        
          }
          
          ListItem.defaultProps = {
            title: "Coffee",
            content: "coffee machine"
          }
        export default ListItem
        
    </figure>
