    <h3>Props</h3>
    <h2>What props are in principle?</h2>
    <p>React has a concept known as props, props is just a shorter way of saying properties. Props allow us to make our components reusable by passing data from one component to
    another with the use of parameters. Props are passed to a JSX tag.</p>
    <h2>Why you'd want to use props</h2>
    <p>By allowing us to pass data to the custom component by adding a property we are able to access all of these
        They are useful when you want the flow of data in your app to be dynamic.</p>
