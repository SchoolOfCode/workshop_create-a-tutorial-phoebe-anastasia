    <h1>Phoebe & Anastasia's React Guide</h1>
    <h3>Props</h3>
    <h2>What props are in principle?</h2>
    <br>
    <p>React has a concept known as props, props is just a shorter way of saying properties. Props allow us to make our components reusable by passing data from one component to
    another with the use of parameters. Props are passed to a JSX tag.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Why you'd want to use props</h2>
    <br>
    <p> We are able to access all of the properties by passing the data dynamically in App.js to the custom component (from a parent component to a child component(s)).</p>
    <br>
    <h2>How you'd want to use them</h2>
    <br>
    <p><b>Using props without destructuring</b></p>
    <br>
    <p>You need to pass props as an argument to the function for your custom component similar to how you would pass an argument in a vanilla JavaScript function; </p>
    <figure>
        function ListItem (props) {
            const title = props.title;
            const content = props.content;
              return (
                <div>
                  <h1>{title}.</h1>
                  <p>My favorite item is {content}.</p>
                </div>
              );
          }
          
          export default ListItem
    </figure>
    <br>
    <p><b>Using props with destructuring</b></p>
    <br>
    <p>Similarly, to the previous section the code is exactly the same as without destructuring props. The only difference is where you're declaring props they're passed as a variable to the function instead of as an argument.</p>
    <figure>
        function ListItem({title, content}) {
  
            return (
              <div>
                <h1>{title}.</h1>
                <p>My favorite item is {content}.</p>
              </div>
            );
        }
        
        export default ListItem
    </figure>
    <p><b>Setting default values for props</b></p>
    <br>
    <p>You can also pass funtions and data from objects in your props. You can pass in default value to your props if you'd rather them be empty when created;</p>
    <figure>
        function ListItem({title, content}) {

            return (
              <div>
                <h1>{title}.</h1>
                <p>My favorite item is {content}.</p>
              </div>
            );
        
          }
          
          ListItem.defaultProps = {
            title: "Coffee",
            content: "coffee machine"
          }
        export default ListItem
        
    </figure>
    <br>
    </p>
    <h3>State</h3>
    <h2>What is state in principle?</h2>
    <br/>
    <p>In React the state is a built-in object that contains data or information about the component.
    In other words, state is data that we need to manage over time within our application.
useState is a function within React library used as a React Hook which allows us to declare values as a state so that
when changes to these values occur, the Component function is called again.</p>
    <h2>Why you'd want to use state?</h2>
    <br/>
    <p> In React we want to be able to respond to events and data from the user in real time in order to have an interactive application.
        We are able to store and update the state in the variable rather than the state existing in the browser. This ensures the users' viewing experience is the most up-to-date version.
    </p>
</br>
 <h2>How you'd want to use state.</h2>
 <br/>
 <p><b>Convention of useState</b></p>
 <br/>
<figure>
const [title, setTitle] = useState('');
</figure>
<p>Here we've called useState and in doing so we are telling React to manage the title of listItem. As a standard practice you declare this pair as const [something, setSomething]. The first time it's called it takes an argument as the initial value of it's state.
In this example, the title of list item is set as an empty string. If the list item is assigned a new title the componnent is then re-executed as a state change has occurred. This updated List item is extracted by React to give the most up-to-date state snapshot.
</p>
<br>
<figure>
    import React, { useState } from 'react';

    function ListItem({title, content}) {

        // function clickHandler()
    
        const [title, setTitle] = useState(props.title);
      
        const clickHandler = () => {
          setTitle('Updated!');
          console.log(title);
        };
    
        return (
          <div>
            <h1>{title}.</h1>
            <p>My favorite item is {content}.</p>
            <button onClick={clickHandler}>Change Title</button>
          </div>
        );
    }
    export default ListItem
</figure>
